== life lessons maybe?

[NOTE]
.*Here’s 32 things I’ve learned that I hope help you in your journey*:
====

. Nothing worthwhile comes easy. 
. Work on a passion project, even just 30 minutes a day. It compounds.
. Become a lifelong learner (best tip).
. Working from 7am to 7pm isn’t productivity. It’s guilt.
. To be really successful become useful.
. Like houses in need of repair, problems usually don’t fix themselves.
. Don’t say something to yourself that you wouldn’t say to someone else. 
. Try to spend 12 minutes a day in quiet reflection, meditation, or prayer.
. Try new things. If it doesn’t work out, stop. At least you tried.
. You can’t control everything. Focus on what you can control.
. If you think you have it tough, look around.
. It's only over when you say it is.
