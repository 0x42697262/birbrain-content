This is where I store my temporary notes to which I still haven't made any progress or a deeper understanding of the topic or concept.

Basically, this place is an _illusion of knowledge_ (heh).
I have xref:links.adoc[websites] that I store here too which would probably be a permanent note residence here.
I mean that makes sense, right?
Linking websites doesn't mean I deeply understood the contents in there.
So basically a bookmark...
