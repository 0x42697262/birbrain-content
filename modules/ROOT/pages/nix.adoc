== Custom Nix Location

WARNING: DO NOT SEPARATE THE NIX STORE LOCATION. IT IS BETTER TO MOVE `/nix/` TO ANOTHER DIRECTORY INSTEAD.

Make sure that permissions are kept as is for `/nix`.

[, bash]
----
# mount --bind /path/to/nix /nix
----

For permanent solution, update your `/etc/fstab` with the following:

./etc/fstab
----
/path/to/nix /nix none bind 0 0
