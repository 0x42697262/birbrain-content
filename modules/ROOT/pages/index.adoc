Welcome to my personal knowledge base.
Everything that matters to me will be stored here.
This serves as a structured place to organize my thoughts, notes, and random findings.

== Structure

My notes are categorized into three main sections:

- xref:ROOT:index.adoc[**ROOT/**] → Knowledge base notes
- xref:幻想:index.adoc[**幻想/**] → Random stash (TODO lists, collected links, finished readings, etc.)
- xref:日記:index.adoc[**日記/**] → Daily notes

== Learning Approach

To deepen understanding, I follow a simple method:

. Predict
. Simulate
. Analyze

I hope to apply this not only on studying but also to other areas of life.
