== Tips

=== Checking Specific Instances of classes using match()

[, python]
----
class Entity:
  ...

class Human(Entity):
  ...


joe = Human()
obj = Entity()

match joe:
  case _ if type(joe) is Entity:
    print("It should not evaluate to this case")
  case _ if type(joe) is Human:
    print("It should evaluate to this case")
  case _:
    print("It won't.")

match obj:
  case _ if type(joe) is Human:
    print("It should evaluate to this case")
  case _ if type(joe) is Entity:
    print("It should not evaluate to this case")
  case _:
    print("Another test to confirm")
----

``_ if`` is used for extending custom conditions since pattern matching does not work for booleans.
