I no longer use https://obsidian.md[Obsidian] for taking notes.
Everything will be stored here including other stuffs that I do.
I didn't like my setup in https://github.com/KrulYuno/obsidian_files[Obsidian Notes] and was annoying to keep track of the files.

This xref:setup.adoc[setup] feels much easier to track although it has a few features that I miss from Obsidian (like backlinks, wikilinks, and graphs).
