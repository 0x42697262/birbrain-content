== Converting An Image

You can convert an image to other formats using ``qemu-img convert``.
Since I use QEMU as my main virtualization software, I'll convert them to ``.qcow2`` image.

=== .ova Image


Unpack the .ova image format.

[sh]
****
$ tar -xvf __input__.ova
****

That should give extract two files: ``.vmdk`` and ``.ovf``.

``.vmdk`` needs to be converted into `.qcow2` image format.


[sh]
****
$ qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 __input__.vmdk __output__.qcow2
****

NOTE: There are more necessary steps involved to make the images work like networking.

Explanations for the parameters.

-f:: first image format
-O:: output image format

See ``man qemu-img`` for more info.
