Some videos watched:

. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHyNqSnzP8Y[13. Learning: Genetic Algorithms]
. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihX3-WDua2I[Neat AI does Flappy Birds using NEAT and a Genetic Algorithm]
. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsGvCwaaMOI[Building the Flappy Bird A.I. without LIBRARIES | Genetic Algorithm | Python/PyCharm] - quite tiresome to watch. i just wanted an explanation or logic of the code, not line by line explanation.
