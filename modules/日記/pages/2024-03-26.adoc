When there's an instruction saying to follow something, follow it.
Don't fricking skip it.

I just fixed my VMWare install after trying to uninstall and reinstall it a bunch of times.
Because I deleted ``/etc/vmware`` and it finally installed properly.

Got it running.

I also got dev key thanks to someone.
