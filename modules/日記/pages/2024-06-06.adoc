Today I learned that I despise taking notes...
Well, not entirely.
Turns out my method of note taking is terrible and taxing to my brain.
Which makes me lose focus on the topic.

Instead I will start taking notes that *matters to me*.
It is similar to Selective Note Taking approach but it's not optimized for efficiency.
This approach focuses more on decreasing mental drain as much as possible.
