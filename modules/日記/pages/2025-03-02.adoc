=== level 13

well, this level was confusing at first glance but apparently it's simple.

just don't login on another machine, make sure to login from **bandit13**.

[, bash]
----
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
----

then i was able to grab the password for level 14 from `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`.

=== level 14

i thought this level still uses `ssh`, apparently it's `netcat`...

anyways, i simply need to send data to port *30000* on **localhost**.

this won't work, apparently, when i'm not logged in as **bandit14**.

[, bash]
----
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | grep -Eo '[A-Za-z0-9]{32}' | nc localhost 30000
----
