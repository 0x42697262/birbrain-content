== incus webcam passhtrough permission error

[, yaml]
----
webcam:
    mode: "0777"
    path: /dev/video0
    required: "false"
    source: /dev/video0
    type: unix-char
----

the fix is to add `0777` as permission although this might be a security risk

also add `required: false` so that when camera isn't plugged in, the container doesn't fail to start.

there should be a better way to passthrough cam + mic.
i'll look for it next time
