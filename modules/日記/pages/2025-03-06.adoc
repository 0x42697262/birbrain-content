i have no idea how `setuid` works.
i still have not figured out why this works at all.
it's very confusing.

my thought process on this one is that **setuid** works by running a command from another user because that binary said so.


[, bash]
----
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
----

normally, you dont have permission to read */etc/bandit_pass/bandit20* password.
maybe that's how *setuid* works?
no idea

[, bash]
----
ssh -t bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20"
----
