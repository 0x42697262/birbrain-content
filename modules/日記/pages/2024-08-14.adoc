Trying to figure out *IPv6*.
I can host it using Python `python -m http.server --bind ::`.

Now I wonder if it works on LAN.
_Update: It does work on LAN._
It doesn't work on public IP though.
It might be a firewall issue.

To access IPv6 on Firefox, use this kind of URL notation `http://[::]:80/`.
