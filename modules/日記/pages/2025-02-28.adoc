== find the file that contains regex

[, bash]
----
find . -type f -exec sh -c 'strings "$1" | grep -qE "^[A-Za-z0-9]{32}$"' _ {} \;
----

== overthewire

=== level 6

the challenge was the same as the previous level.

using manpages for `find`, we get this following:

----
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c ! -executable  2>/dev/null
----

the `2>/dev/null` exists to get rid of all **Permission denied** errors getting printed to the standard output.

=== level 7

interesting challenge, not that difficult.

certainly, i can still use `grep` to solve this level: `cat data.txt | grep millionth`.

but it's quite restrictive if it were applied on another scenario (hinting level 8 here).
which is why i tried using `sed` then pipe it to `awk`.

i have used this before but never figured them out properly in the past.

simply put, just chain those two together: `sed -n '/^millionth\t/p' data.txt | awk '{print $2}'`.
