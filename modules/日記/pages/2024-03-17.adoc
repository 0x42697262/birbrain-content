== xref macro

Using ``xref`` as a way to relatively link other notes in xref:Antora[Antora] can be done through this pattern:

----
component:module:file.adoc[file]
----

As an example, this links to the index of xref:幻想:index.adoc[幻想].

== page aliases

I can also use ``:page-aliases:`` to refer to a note that might keep moving like xref:幻想:幻想.adoc[this].

The only issue is that i have to follow the ``component:module:file`` or ``module:file`` format.
This will reduce its usefulness when a note is from another componenet, but that should not be an issue because I will be setting up the components with different purposes.
