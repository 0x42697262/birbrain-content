overall, tried to see if i can limit my cpu watts draw

== installed aur packages:

* ryzen_smu
* zenpower3
* powertop
* ryzenadj

== activity log

tried to set the frequency using ``cpulimit`` and it still used the same battery watts.

thought of setting the maximum watts of the cpu through ``ryzenadj``, it didn't work even with ``ryzen_smu`` installed.

firefox slows down a lot if only 1 thread is allotted.
2 threads should be the minimum.
yet still teh same wattage drain.

``powertop`` still says laptop draws 15W to 42W.
which supposedly should be set to only 8W.
