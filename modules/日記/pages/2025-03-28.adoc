i made a xref:幻想:todo.adoc[to do list] because i keep forgetting what i need to do. _badumtss_

oh, and finished writeups for https://ctf.hackthebox.com/event/details/cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2025-tales-from-eldoria-2107[HackTheBox Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2025: Tales from Eldoria].

Forensics writeups: xref:writeups:HackTheBox:a-new-hire.adoc[A new hire] xref:writeups:HackTheBox:thorins-amulet.adoc[Thorin's Amulet].

== github

probably i should take not about `git commit --amend` since that's what I "need" to do, not `git commit -a` which is another different thing

added new notes:

* xref:ROOT:nix.adoc[]

== nix

[, bash]
----
$ nix flake update
path '/home/user/home-manager' does not contain a 'flake.nix', searching up
error: path '/home/user/home-manager' is not part of a flake (neither it nor its parent directories contain a 'flake.nix' file)
----

`flake.nix` must exist

[, bash]
----
nix flake update          
error: path '/nix/store/6ychk6zrxyhzxbpx7wrjmp7hbg0nap04-source/flake.nix' does not exist
----

solution: `git add flake.nix`


if there's a new file, make sure to add it to git.
