I noticed that I kept changing user groups and it's quite annoying having to relogin just to apply the changes for the user.
There is a method (or command?) allowing me to use the new group without relogging in, it's ``newgrp``.
Neat handy tool.

Although make sure to run it with escalated privileges otherwise it would take effect.
To know if the user has logged in with the new group, check it with ``id``.
