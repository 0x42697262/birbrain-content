== incus get audio working for non-pipewire supported applications

this is how i fixed wine audio not working for osu! stable.
it works for roblox as well

[, yaml]
----
devices:
  pulse:
    bind: container
    connect: unix:/run/user/1000/pulse/native
    listen: unix:/mnt/.sockets/pulse-native
    mode: "0777"
    type: proxy
----

then in /etc/profile

./etc/profile
[, bash]
----
ln -sf /mnt/.sockets/pulse-native /run/user/1000/pulse-native
export PULSE_SERVER=unix:/run/user/1000/pulse-native
----

it might be needed to set wine sound to pulse:

----
$ winetricks sound=pulse
----

make sure to have this packages installed:

* pulseaudio
* alsa-lib
* libpulse
