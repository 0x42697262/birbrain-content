== Practical Binary Analysis

Reading about https://practicalbinaryanalysis.com[Practical Binary Analysis] again.
I am not sure if I can dedicate to this like how I have failed dedicating to learning malware development...

I didn't want to install the binaries and tools directly on my host machine so I decided to just download the VM:

It is a bit slow but hopefully I don't become a leecher...

== Knowledge-Base

I feel like my daily notes are getting longer... I need to build a neovim extension soon.
