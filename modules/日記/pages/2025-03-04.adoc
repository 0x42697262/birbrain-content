== overthewire

=== level 17

this level is simple, the task is to identify the difference between the two files.

hence, `diff` is the solution.

[, bash]
----
diff passwords.old passwords.new passwords.old
----

**<** is used because i wanted to grab the password for the next level on the `passwords.new` file.

[, bash]
----
ssh -t bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "diff passwords.new passwords.old | awk '\$1==\"<\" {print \$2}'" 
----

=== level 18

the solution is what i've already been using ever since!

`scp`!!!

[, bash]
----
scp -P 2220 bandit1$@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:./readme .
----

well the alternative method is to just use `ssh`

[, bash]
----
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
----
