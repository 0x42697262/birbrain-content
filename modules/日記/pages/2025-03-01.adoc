=== level 8

so, the trick is to sort it first then find the unique line.

i used `sort` and `uniq` to this level.

the overall command to solve this challenge is:

[, bash]
----
sort data.txt | uniq -c | awk '$1==1 {print $2}'
----

=== level 9

look like it's the same as the previous level.

[, bash]
----
strings data.txt | grep -E '==+' | awk '{print $2}' | grep -E '^[A-Za-z0-9]{32}$'
----

=== level 10

ezpz, i've been doing this since the dawn of my linux journey:

[, bash]
----
cat data.txt | base64 -d | grep -Eo '[A-Za-z0-9]{32}'
----
