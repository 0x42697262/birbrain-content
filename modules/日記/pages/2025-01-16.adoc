A big DNS vulnerability found in 2008 by Dan Kaminsky.
DNS poisoning is attacked through Content Delivery Networks (CDN).
I don't really get how *Kaminsky attack* works.
The basic idea is that a malicious DNS is hosted which gets used by the users.
Although, how can someone attack local area network to poison the DNS cache?
A https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8384122[paper] by Tripathi et. al. might provide insights to DNS poisoning in LAN. 

Is Kaminsky attack still possible?
Probably the answer is "no" based on this https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/choi/it432/lec/l07/lec.html[lecture].
