Why not try writing in 日本語?

== xref:ROOT:github-actions.adoc[Github Actions]

[line-through]#Nevermind I can't write in 日本語 yet.#

Trying to figure out how I can automate xref:ROOT:antora.adoc[Antora] to automatically build the xref:ROOT:github-pages.adoc[Github Pages] when a source content is being pushed.
I used these sites as my main sources:

. https://medium.com/hostspaceng/triggering-workflows-in-another-repository-with-github-actions-4f581f8e0ceb[] The only one that worked the best
. https://dev.to/moaaz_adel/github-actions-a-simple-way-to-trigger-workflow-from-another-workflow-1b55[] I read this first, but it didn't work. I did use its second workflow file though
. https://medium.com/@husnainsiddique581/trigger-github-action-from-another-repo-using-trigger-workflow-and-wait-api-f2e572cb22b7[] I'm not sure if I even read this.
