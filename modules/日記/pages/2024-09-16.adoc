Jason was a dickhead to their roommates.
AC asked Jason politely to change his behavior.
Jason didn't like it.
So, Jason went and brushed AC's toothbrush on the toilet.
AC caught Jason doing the act when Jason scrubbed AC's toothbrush again.
After that, AC drank his supposedly new water bottle.
It tasted weird.
This caused AC to shutdown his liver, basically killing it.
AC acquired ``hyperammonemia``, high ammonia presence in blood.
A neurotoxin that impairs the brain's electricity.
AC's brain were bleeding because the liver is dying and is no longer capable of digesting proteins.
The cause of toxic poisoning is **N-Nitrosodimethylamine** (NDMA).
