Most(?) SIM cards are built with Java Card.
Probably we can build it using https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javacard-downloads.html[Java Card Development Kit].
It actually has low life expectancy, about 1,000 to 500,000 write cycles.



Check these:

PCSC::
Get *PCSC* (PC/Smartcard API) reader for interfacing.

SIM Alliance Loader::
quite slow java app for loading apps inside the java cards, might take at least 2 minutes, also built for windows

GlobalPlatform::
Issuer Security Domain, which can only be communicated with OTA updates.

LOADing and INSTALLing the app authorization.

**AIDs**:

. Application AID
. Module AID
. Instance AID
